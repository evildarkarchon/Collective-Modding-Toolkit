    progress_value = Signal(float)  # Progress bar updates
    folder_update = Signal(tuple)  # Folder list updates
    problem_found = Signal(list)  # Problem list updates
    scan_complete = Signal()
    
    def run(self):
        # Implement full scan_data_files logic
        # Emit signals instead of queue.put()
```

### 2. Result Tree Population - Complete

        self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_ShowWithoutActivating)
        
    def update_position(self):
        # Positions to right of main window
        # Falls back to left if would go off-screen
        # Respects screen boundaries
        
    def mousePressEvent/mouseMoveEvent/mouseReleaseEvent:
        # Custom window dragging implementation
        
    def showEvent:
        # Auto-positions on show
```

### Remaining Major Tasks
1. **Scanner Tab Completion** (11-16 hours)
   - Core scanning logic
   - Threading implementation
   - Window management
   - Result display and interaction
   
2. **Modal Dialogs** (4-6 hours)

   - Archive Patcher dialog
   - About/Tree windows
   - Message boxes

3. **Testing & Polish** (2-4 hours)
   - Integration testing

   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes

**Total Remaining Effort**: ~10-15 hours

## Conclusion

The Scanner tab is approximately 60% complete in terms of Qt migration. The basic structure is in place, but the core functionality needs to be implemented. The main challenges are:

1. Converting the threading model from Python threads/queues to Qt threads/signals
2. Implementing the complex file scanning logic
3. Managing multiple windows (main, side pane, details pane)
4. Preserving all the problem detection logic

The implementation should focus on maintaining feature parity with the Tkinter version while taking advantage of Qt's superior threading and event handling capabilities.

Five of the six tabs are fully migrated and functional. The Scanner tab remains the primary challenge due to its complexity, but with the patterns established in the other tabs and this detailed roadmap, completion is straightforward albeit time-consuming.
