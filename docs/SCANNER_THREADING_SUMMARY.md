# Scanner Threading System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The scanner module's threading system has been expanded to provide a robust, Qt-based threading infrastructure that replaces the original Tkinter implementation. This new system leverages the existing `qt_threading.py` base classes while adding scanner-specific functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. **ScannerWorkerSignals** (`scanner_threading.py`)
Extended signal class that provides scanner-specific signals:
- `progress_text`: Status text updates
- `progress_value`: Progress bar updates (0-100)
- `scan_stage`: Current scan stage notifications
- `folder_update`: Folder list discovery
- `current_folder`: Current folder being scanned
- `problem_found`: Single problem discovered
- `problems_found`: Batch of problems discovered
- `scan_stats`: Scan statistics updates

### 2. **Thread-Safe Data Structures**

#### ScanProgressState
- Manages scan progress with thread-safe accessors
- Tracks current folder, progress percentage, and statistics
- Uses `QMutex` for thread safety

#### ThreadSafeResultAccumulator
- Accumulates scan results safely across threads
- Provides methods to add single or multiple problems
- Thread-safe retrieval of all results

### 3. **ScanWorker** (`scanner_threading.py`)
The main worker class that:
- Inherits from `BaseWorker[list[ProblemInfo | SimpleProblemInfo]]`
- Implements the full scanning logic ported from `scan_data_files`
- Emits signals instead of using queue-based communication
- Supports cancellation through the `is_running` property
- Batches problem discoveries for efficiency

### 4. **Updated ScannerTab** (`_scanner_qt.py`)
The Qt scanner tab now:
- Uses `ThreadManager` to manage the scan thread lifecycle
- Connects worker signals to UI update slots
- Handles thread cleanup on tab switches
- Implements proper error handling

## Migration from Tkinter

| Tkinter Approach | Qt Approach | Benefits |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `threading.Thread` | `QThread` with `BaseWorker` | Built-in Qt integration |
| `queue.Queue` | Qt Signals | Type-safe, automatic thread marshaling |
| `after()` polling | Signal/slot connections | Event-driven, more efficient |
| Manual thread management | `ThreadManager` | Centralized lifecycle management |
| Direct UI updates | Slot methods | Thread-safe UI updates |

## Signal Flow

1. **Scan Start**:
   - UI creates `ScanWorker` with settings
   - Connects all signals to appropriate slots
   - `ThreadManager.start_worker()` launches thread

2. **During Scan**:
   - Worker emits progress signals
   - UI slots update progress bar, labels
   - Problems batched and emitted periodically

3. **Scan Complete**:
   - `result_ready` signal with final results
   - `finished` signal triggers cleanup
   - UI populates tree with results

## Usage Example

```python
# Create worker
worker = ScanWorker(cmc, scan_settings, overview_problems)

# Connect signals
worker.signals.progress.connect(self.on_progress)
worker.signals.problems_found.connect(self.on_problems_found)
worker.signals.result_ready.connect(self.on_scan_complete)
worker.signals.error_occurred.connect(self.on_scan_error)

# Start scan
thread_manager.start_worker(worker, "scanner_thread")
```

## Thread Safety Guarantees

1. **Signal Emission**: All signals are thread-safe by design
2. **Data Access**: Result accumulator uses mutex protection
3. **Cancellation**: Safe cancellation through `stop()` method
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup via `ThreadManager`

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Batch Processing**: Problems emitted in batches to reduce signal overhead
2. **Progress Throttling**: Progress updates calculated efficiently
3. **Early Exit**: Cancellation checks throughout scanning loops
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Results accumulated incrementally

## Error Handling

The system provides comprehensive error handling:
- Worker exceptions caught and emitted via `error_occurred` signal
- UI can display error dialogs based on error signals
- Thread cleanup guaranteed even on errors

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **Reusability**: Leverages existing infrastructure
3. **Testability**: Worker logic isolated from UI
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new signals/features
5. **Reliability**: Proper thread lifecycle management
